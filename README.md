Making Python track D&amp;D rolls for me

You can download it for OS X on the [releases page](https://github.com/LindseyB/nat20-py/releases/tag/v0.1)

Updating the character sheet: Inside the .app navigate to `Contents/Resources/sheet.yaml`
The yaml is in the form of:

```
Character Name:
  Roll Name: d20 + 5
  Other Roll Name: 5 * d20 + d4
  Another Roll: d20 - 1
```
